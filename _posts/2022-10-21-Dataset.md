Just like preparing for war, creating and preparing a dataset is crucial for a data scientist wanting to explore datasets.  In the Book of Mormon, we can see that the author wanted the reader to understand the significance of the Nephites' preparation for the inevitable war against the Lamanites.  When creating your dataset (especially when combining tables from several different sources), there are countless ways that it can go wrong and tiny details that statisticians have to keep in mind.  I will be showing techniques of how to manipulate data in a dataset, as well as problems that can occur during the webscraping process.  

## Building an Army

The dataset I created is a joined dataframe of the units in the classic Nintendo series, Fire Emblem.  I know I explained the basic premise of the game in my previous blog post, but just in case you haven't read it, Fire Emblem is a tactical role playing game where you control an army of soldiers each with their own unique personalities, strengths, and designs.  As they defeat enemies, they level up over time.  Each unit has several stats that have a different percent chance of increasing by one.  I have attached a visual for clarity.

## Why make a dataset like this?  What is the goal?

As a huge fan of both data exploration and game design, I want to be able to compare different variables between games to better understand how the developers balanced the difficulty.  By making a dataset of my own, I have a convenient way to import the data into a program and explore it myself.  Since this data has been public for several years, I see no trouble webscraping it with the requests package in python.
