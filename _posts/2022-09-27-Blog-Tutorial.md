 Manipulating ANY Dataset

Being a Statistics major, I often have to do projects that involve working with many different data sets.  These can include the wind speed at certain reference sites
in order to predict the speed of the candidate site, or the effect of restaurant ratings and the price of their food.  These was not exciting for me to analyze 
personally, but I recognize their importance.  However, one of the reasons I enjoy statistics is for the potential one has to analyze the infinite amount of data
available for free on the web.  This is why I do not understand why when many of my fellow students have the opportunity to take a sample of data, they decide to
sample the frequency of colors from M&M's.  I want to show how data wrangling can be made easy and fun.  As I and many other students have been taught in their childhoods,
how to liken the data unto ourselves.

For this example, I have decided to analyze data from something near to my heart, Fire Emblem.
