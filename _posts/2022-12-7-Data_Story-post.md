One thing that has always drawn me to statistics is just how it can be applied to anything.  If someone love movies,
you can find data that can answer many interesting questions lead to interesting observations. For example, a statistician can hypothesize that male actors 
receive more lines than female actors in movies.  He/she can then gather data and make prove or disprove their analysis.  If he/she wanted to take it further,
they could compare the average amount of lines by gender depending on genre of movie.  If they are lucky, their findings may be published for a good sum of money.  

As for myself, this aspect of statistics had inspired the data that I have gathered over this past semester.  I wanted to utilize statistics for fun rather
than just as another assignment.  As a fan of video games and game design, I wanted to collect data related to one of my favorites so I could have my passion
for them reflect what were in my blogs.

My data project was for the role playing video game series, Fire Emblem.  Getting this data was surprisingly easy, only needing to scrape the data from serenesforest.net.  
My initial inspiration was to study the stats of the characters in the game.  I made several several plots comparing several different variables.  While many of my
hypothesis proved to be false, it was still interesting to get an insight of how the game developers designed the characters attributes.  Many of the correlations
I thought would be significant were not.  If you are interested in a more in-depth look at my data gathering and exploration, you can refer to my previous blogs.

However, as much as I love analyzing data for personal gratification, I also want to show something from this data journey is more interesting to 
the average person as an example of how accessible data exploration is.  One thing I notice (and don't support) in games is how overly cute and
'beautiful' the females tend to be. I believe the same is true for role playing games, which inspired me to make this graphic to see if these design
choices really have an impact on character popularity.
