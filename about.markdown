# About Me

I am currently a student at Brigham Young University who will be graduating next April with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Statistics.  I am skilled in many programming languages including R, Python, MySQL, and Linux.  My hobby is using my regression analysis and coding skills to analyze data of popular media.
